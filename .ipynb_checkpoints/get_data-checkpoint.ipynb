    "In this project, I will classify clinical trials for oncology drugs as \"successful\" or \"failed\" based on features extracted from the CDEK database, cross-referenced with the AACT database. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data sources\n",
    "The [Clinical Drug Experience Knowledgebase (CDEK)](http://cdek.wustl.edu) is a database and web platform of active pharmaceutical ingredients with evidence of clinical testing as well as the organizations involved in their research and development. CDEK aggregates metadata surrounding active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the details of clinical trial design, intended indications, and organizations responsible for development. The envisioned use of the CDEK is to support the investigation of many aspects of drug development, including discovery, repurposing opportunities, chemo- and bio-informatics, clinical and translational research, and regulatory sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get clinical trial metadata not currently stored in CDEK, I cross-reference with the [AACT database](https://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/aact-database). ClinicalTrials.gov is a repository of clinical trial registrations in the United States and is maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The AACT database was developed and is maintained by the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) group, a government-academic collaboration between the FDA and Duke University. The AACT database contains ClinicalTrials.gov data that has been parsed and deposited into a structured relational database. AACT also links clinical trials data to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms), a controlled vocabulary containing terms describing disease indications and interventions. This mapping enables querying the data by intervention and disease indication terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Process\n",
    "The steps included in this project are as follows: \n",
    "1. Extract feature data and target data from CDEK and AACT\n",
    "2. Clean data and structure into a Pandas dataframe\n",
    "3. Perform feature engineering to set up data for classification model\n",
    "4. Train and validate classification deep neural network\n",
    "5. Evaluate model accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "## About this notebook\n",
    "This notebook performs steps 1 and 2 of the project process. \n"

To get a set of \"failed\" trials, I extract the why_stopped field from AACT when it is not null. To get a list of successful oncology drugs, I will extract Phase II trials from CDEK where there is a Phase III trial for that same drug-indication pair. This suggests that the drug successfully went on from phase II to phase III. "
